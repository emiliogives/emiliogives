# Welcome Traveler! 

I'm Emilio Gives a full-stack developer with a passion for creating high-quality software solutions. I specialize in **.NET** development, with expertise in frameworks like **ASP.NET, Blazor, and Xamarin**. I'm also comfortable working with **Python and Django** when the need arises. However, my journey has taken me to code in PHP and script in PowerShell or Bash.

In databases, I usually walk the **SQL Server** path, but I'm always willing to explore other options like **MySQL** and NoSQL (like Mongo) for schemas such as CQRS.

My path is in cloud computing; I love getting my hands dirty with services like **Azure and AWS**.

My main area of focus backend on mobile and web development, and I've been in this journey for some years now. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me hiking or tinkering with new gadgets ü§ìüñ•Ô∏è

I'm always looking to connect with other developers and share ideas, so don't hesitate to reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emiliogives/) or check out some of my contributions on this profile.

Hi there! I'm Emilio Gives, a full-stack developer with a passion for creating high-quality software solutions. I specialize in .NET development, with expertise in frameworks like ASP.NET, Blazor, and Xamarin. I'm also comfortable working with Python and Django when the need arises.

When it comes to databases, SQL Server is my go-to, but I'm always willing to explore other options like MySQL. I believe that cloud computing is the future of software development, and I love getting my hands dirty with services like Azure and AWS.

My main areas of focus are middleware solutions and mobile development, and I've been in the game for some years now. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me hiking or tinkering with new gadgets.

I'm always looking to connect with other developers and share ideas, so don't hesitate to reach out to me on LinkedIn or check out some of my recent projects on my portfolio website.
